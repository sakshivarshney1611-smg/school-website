# school-website
This is a sample school website project created for practice and portfolio purposes. It demonstrates how to build a complete educational website with sections like Home, About, Faculty, Admissions, Events, Gallery, and Contact. The project is not an official AMU website â€“ it is only made for learning and showcasing web development skills.
